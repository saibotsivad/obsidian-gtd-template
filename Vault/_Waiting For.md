aliases:
  - "#waiting-for"

These are all open tasks that are waiting for someone else. It would be much nicer to create a Dataview to only list e.g. people with waiting-for, so that you could quickly see "I'm talking with Jim and he has some open loops" but not have to scroll through all of them.

```tasks
tags includes #waiting-for
path regex does not match /^Reference\//
not done
```
