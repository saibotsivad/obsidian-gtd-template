This is an example project that has grown so big that it has additional projects and references enough that it's convenient to put it in a sub-folder.

The name of the file that matches the folder is the "main" project.

## Outcome
TBD
## Goal
Build or buy my way to outer space.
## Motivation
I believe I will feel self fulfilled if I can look down on the blue earth in amazement.
## People
| Person | Team | Role |
| - | - | - |
| #p/Tobias-Davis | Space Engineers | The main person who is trying to build a rocket |
## Standing Meetings
- Monday 08:00 #m/space-travel "Space Travel Sync" #p/Tobias-Davis
## Project Tracking
- [ ] #next-step sketch out a proposed roadmap and highlight chunks of work
## High Level
- Bigger rockets
	- the rocket engines we have will only get us halfway
- Process improvements
	- engineers need to machine the widgets more carefully
	- maybe #p/Tobias-Davis can invent antigravity?
## Notes
- Random notes here, and cross-link to references as quick links out
## Tasks
