- Unchecked tasks in `/Journal` and `/Reference` shouldn't exist, I think, in proper GTD. Keep this list in the `_Inbox` file, and it should always be empty. Maybe a query like this?
```
(root includes Journal) OR (root includes Reference)
not done
```

- Could be useful: a shortcut to take the currently focused task and move it to today or inbox maybe and auto add the start day from the file its in as part of curating journal entries, maybe leave a link, or cross link somehow? maybe adding the start date would be enough?
