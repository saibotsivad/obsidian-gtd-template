This folder is where I keep things that I have started to gain a little traction on but I don't want to fully commit to yet.

They are inside the "Projects" folder because then they can make use of the "next step" plugin.

This particular file is where I scratch out ideas and concepts, and then if/as they gain traction I'll move them to a dedicated file in this "Someday Maybe" folder.
