I have an [Alfred](https://alfred.app/) workflow that makes it easy for me to append entries to this table of miles walked while working.

I have a different script that then takes this data and gives me a 👍/👎 of whether I'm walking enough.

| Date       | Time  | Miles | Feeling | Speed   |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| 2025-09-29 | 11:32 | 2.22  | 8       | 2.0mph  |
