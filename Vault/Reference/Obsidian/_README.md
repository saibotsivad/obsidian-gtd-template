Things in this folder are snippets and templates and so on for use inside Obsidian.

I can't put a `_README.md` inside some of them, because the file lists can be used to propagate UI lists.

## Templater

Used by the Templater plugin as the folder to use when using the "insert template" prompt.

- `New *.md` - Used to create new files of particular kinds. See each file for notes.
- `Agenda/Meeting - *.md` - Used to insert meeting templates into daily notes.

## VirtualFooter

Used by the Virtual Footer plugin for templates. Inserts snippets at the top of special notes. See each note for details.
