These are files that you would put inside `.obsidian/snippets`:

- [style.css](./style.css) - My overall mods to Obsidian, but it should be refactored out because it has some DataView/Tasks plugin tweaks as well.
- [tasks.css](./tasks.css) - Modify some visuals about the Tasks plugin.


These are settings for plugins:

- [virtual-footer.json](./virtual-footer.json) - Settings for Virtual Footer.
