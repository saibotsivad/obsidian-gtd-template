I keep notes on people so that I can interact with them and more easily build good relationships and communicate well.

Example things I'll make note of:

- Personal interests and experiences, things like previous jobs, hobbies
- Family life, like travel plans or goals
- Dates of big life events, things like "date new baby was born" or sad events
- Things that bother them
- Observations on communication methods

If you know that you'll have a very large list of people, you may want to organize further by sub-folders grouped by last name, for example:
```
/People
	/Davis
		/Tobias Davis.md
```
