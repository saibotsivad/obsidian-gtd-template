These are the notes from today. They are very ad hoc, but every day as part of inbox processing I go through the previous days notes and make sure all actionable items are cleared.

One thing I would like is to change the `tasks` so that it takes into account the day of the file, so that it shows all open tasks on the day it's created, but next day it shows only tasks completed on that day.
